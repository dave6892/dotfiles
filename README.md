I took the [dev-setup](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup) repository by donnemartin, and modified to meet my needs. This is still a working progress, see [TODOs](#todos).

## Motivation

Setting up a new developer machine can be an **ad-hoc, manual, and time-consuming** process.  `dev-setup` aims to **simplify** the process with **easy-to-understand instructions** and **dotfiles/scripts** to **automate the setup** of the following:

* **OS X updates and Xcode Command Line Tools**
* **OS X defaults** geared towards developers
* **Developer tools**: Vim, bash, tab completion, curl, git, GNU core utils, Python, Ruby, etc
* **Developer apps**: iTerm2, Sublime Text, Atom, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, Chrome, etc
* **Python data analysis**: IPython Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc
* **Big Data platforms**: Spark (with IPython Notebook integration) and MapReduce
* **Cloud services**: Amazon Web Services (Boto, AWS CLI, S3cmd, etc) and Heroku
* **Common data stores**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch
* **Javascript web development**: Node.js, JSHint, and Less
* **Android development**: Java, Android SDK, Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA
